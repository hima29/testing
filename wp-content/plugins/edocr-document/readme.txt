= How to I add the Viewer to a Page or Post? =

1. Click on Pages or Posts in navigation
2. Open an existing page/post or create a new one
3. Within the content editor, add a shortcode to editor using the unique
edocr document identifier (aka GUID) similar to this: [edocr guid=aqegexna]
4. Click Save and then view your post

= How do I find my document GUID? =

This plugin adds a shortcode which alows you to embed documents on your page or post that are hosted on edocr.com. For example, if you have a document with the following URL:
```
https://www.edocr.com/v/aqegexna/edocr-service-agreement
```
You'll need to find the documents unique identifier. It's the 8-letter part of the URL directly after the '/v/'. In this example, the unique document identifier (or GUID) is:
```
aqegexna
```
Now simply take your document GUID and use it with our shortcode to add a document to your post or page like this:
```
[edocr guid=aqegexna]
```
Once you save and view your post, you should now have an embedded instance of the document on your WordPress site. You can embed any unrestricted edocr document on the site.
